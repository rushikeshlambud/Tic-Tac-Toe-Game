# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic pencil-and-paper game typically played on a grid of 3x3 squares. Two players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" in an empty square. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
